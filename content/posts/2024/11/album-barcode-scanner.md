I used ESPHome and Home Assistant and an [open-source Python API](https://github.com/andrewthetechie/home-barcode-api) to build a way to scan my [vinyl albums' barcodes](https://www.discogs.com/user/andrewthetechie/collection) and have them play using spotify over my
home's Chromecasts.

## ESPHome Hardware

This project started with an idea: I wonder if I can make esphome read barcodes. Turns out, the answer is an emphatic yes. There [are](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/Barcode_scanner_made_for_ESPHome_bb9bba9a.html) a few [projects](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/gm67-bar-code-reader-module/394182) out there already, but they had one drawback - they TTL based barcode scanners they were using meant that you had to bring the item up to the scanner to scan. I wanted a handheld wireless scanner.

There are lots of handheld barcode scanners for sale, I bought an [inexpensive one from Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806029682141.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.137.77b11802IR5u9Q&gatewayAdapt=glo2usa) for around $15. It operates as a USB HID Device. When plugged into a computer, scanning a barcode will type it into a text field.

My first attempt to make that readable by an ESP was using a [CH9350 HID module](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806406901461.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.142.77b11802IR5u9Q&gatewayAdapt=glo2usa). This module takes a USB device in and then outputs HID codes over TTL. I was able to get this working with an ESP32, but ran into difficulty trying to convert the HID codes into ASCII characters.  [Jann](https://github.com/joetrs) has an [example library](https://github.com/joetrs/ESP32_CH9350_KEY) that I tried to adapt, but I wasn't able to get it working.

Thankfully, Hobbytronics had me covered with their [USB Host Controller Board](https://www.hobbytronics.co.uk/product/host-board). For Â£18, I had to write no code at all. Their pre-loaded firmware did exactly what I want - output the ASCII characters that my HID barcode scanner was "typing". I connected this to an ESP32 and stuck both of them in a small project box with plenty of hot glue to hold everything in place.

The ESPHome device config is intentionally bare bones. A text sensor is setup using a [component](https://github.com/ssieb/esphome_components) that listens for a string coming in via serial. After 10s, the text sensor is reset to "blank" to allow retriggering of the same album. The rest of the config is just ESPHome boilerplate.

## Barcode Lookup API

With a way to scan barcodes, I needed a way to look them up and get a Spotify ID. I use [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/) to organize my vinyl collection, and it offers an [API](https://www.discogs.com/developers). Combining that with the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/search), I had
access to the data I needed.

After researching options to run python scripts in Home Assistant, I decided it would be worth the extra effort to run this code as an external service and then query it in Home Assistant with a [RESTful Command](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/rest_command/). I have some other plans for the API in the future and it gave me a good excuse to play with some FastAPI skills.

The API I put together includes a cache, using SQLAlchemy to offer a range of DB Backends. I deployed the API into my homelab k8s cluster and mounted a 500mb PVC to the pod for SQLite. If you'd like to
deploy it for yourself, there is a [Docker image](https://github.com/andrewthetechie/home-barcode-api/pkgs/container/home-barcode-api) and it takes its config via env vars.

I had to do some very basic cleaning because the Discogs API returns odd results for artists. For example, Tool is returned as "Tool (2)", which the Spotify API doesn't like. I suspect there will be more bugs as I use this system with more than the 20 albums I grabbed out of the my collection.

## Home Assistant

After adding my barcode scanner to Home Assistant via the ESPHome integration, I needed an automation to trigger when a barcode was scanned.

{{< yaml_collapsible file="files/2024/11/album-barcode-scanner/homeassistant.yaml" expand_link_text="Expand HomeAssistant Automation" download_link_text="Download HA Automation" >}}

The automation looks for the text sensor's state to change and then submits that to the API via a RESTful command. If the API returns a 200, it uses TTS to speak the artist and album name and then starts playing using Spotcast. If the automation gets a 404, it uses TTS to read back the error message (which usually results in a cheerful robot reading out a 12 digit number UPC-A.)

## What's Next?

This project was a proof of concept to reliably reading barcodes with ESPHome. In the future, I want to setup a scanner in my kitchen for use with a grocery ERP to track our groceries and household goods.

The music player is really a toy. It'll be a neat thing to show off to visitors that gets used occasionally. My total cost wasn't much for a fun demo and for learning more about ESPhome, Barcodes, HID devices, and Home assistant. I'll eventually replace the turntable.
